# YouTube Trending Video Analysis (Data Engineering Project)

## ðŸ“Œ Project Description  
This project is an end-to-end **on-premise Data Engineering pipeline** built using Microsoft technologies. It uses the **YouTube Trending Video Dataset** from Kaggle, focusing on data from **Canada, the United States, and Brazil**.  

The goal is to build a **data warehouse architecture** that ingests raw files, transforms and integrates them, and finally delivers insights through an **interactive Power BI dashboard**.  
This project was completed as part of my training in **Global Brand Solutions Academy**.  

## ðŸ”Ž Project Overview  
1. **Getting the Data (SSIS)** â†’ Extracted CSV files for Canada, US, and Brazil.  
2. **ODS Layer (SSIS)** â†’ Loaded raw data into the ODS as the initial layer.  
3. **STG Layer (SSIS)** â†’ Performed cleansing, data conversion, and standardization.  
4. **DWH Layer (SSIS)** â†’ Built star schema, added surrogate keys, and created lookups between Fact & Dimensions.  
5. **Semantic Model (SSAS)** â†’ Created relationships and DAX measures for KPIs (views, likes, dislikes, comments).  
6. **Dashboard (Power BI)** â†’ Designed interactive visuals to analyze trends, regional comparisons, and channel performance.  


## ðŸ—‚ Data Extraction Challenges  

While extracting the dataset into **SSIS**, we faced an issue with the **Connection Manager**. Some columns were incorrectly detected as **object** instead of their actual data type.  

ðŸ”Ž After analyzing the problem, we found that the **`title`** column contained text values with embedded commas. These commas confused the CSV parser, causing SSIS to misinterpret column structures.  

âœ… **Solution:**  
We used **Python preprocessing** to fix the issue before loading into SSIS. Specifically, we added quotes (`""`) around any text field containing at least one comma. This ensured that SSIS correctly treated the values as a single column.

## ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Getting the Data & Creating the ODS Layer  

After fixing the **title column issue**, we successfully created the **Connection Manager** for the CSV files. Using the advanced options in the CSV connection manager, we defined the most suitable data types for each column based on the dataset description.  

Next, we created a new database called **`YoutubeODS`** with a table named **`Videos`** using a SQL script.

After preparing the dataset, the CSV files for **Canada, US, and Brazil** were added into the **Data Flow** in the package called **ODS**. The files were then **unioned** and loaded into the **`YoutubeODS.Videos`** table as the destination.

## ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Creating the STG Layer  

After loading the data into the **`YoutubeODS.Videos`** table, the next step was to design the **STG database structure** to prepare the data for the Data Warehouse.  

We started by creating both a **Logical Model** and a **Conceptual Model** to define the dimensions and fact table.

  <img src="Data Models/Conceptual model.png" alt="Conceptual Model" width="400"/>  
</p>  

Based on these models, we created a new database called **`YoutubeSTG`**. This database contains the **Dimension** and **Fact** tables as defined by the modeling step.

After creating the structure, we filled the **Dimensions** and **Fact** tables in the STG database using SSIS, as shown below:
